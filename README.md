**Project Name:** 
Virtual Travel Experience 

**Project Description:**
The project is a web page that takes the user through various travel journeys depending on the user’s choices and preferences. The overall concept of the project is to give the user suggestions for destinations of the tour using questions, visuals, and sounds. The overall theme of the project is journey and exploration. Using this project we are striving to create an extraordinary virtual travel event for people tired and stressed due to the pandemic.

**Process:**
We started by brainstorming for ideas that are journey-based but also interactive. Our initial concept was a call to a travel agency; however, we finally decided that the storyline would be that our website works as a travel agency that asks different questions regarding the traveler’s preference. As a result of each of the callers decisions, the user will be layering up locations until the final destination comes up in a soundscape of the destination. This is when the travel recommendation final screen comes in. Since our storyline is virtual, it was linked to the pandemic and the difficulty of traveling in person. So, the website’s virtual travel event targets users who are tired due to the pandemic and deserve a getaway through the virtual journey. 
Interaction between the user and the content of the website was what we wanted. As a result, we made our website to be user-based and gave the user the freedom of choice between different options. Images and audio along with some texts and buttons were used to keep the user engaged.

**Reflection/Evaluation:**
We initially wanted that based on each of the decisions the user made while clicking the buttons, the user was supposed to be layering up the sounds to make their soundscape. In the end, we wanted to let the user listen to the soundscape they built up themselves. As the phone call progresses the soundscape is building in the background. Our goal was to have the travel agency and the user have a conversation happen in a way. We got it working by recording two different sounds one that resembled the travel agency and the other for the user. By playing with the audio files, we could make the whole conversation have a phone call like effect and sound like you are talking to a travel representative.
