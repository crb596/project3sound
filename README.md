Project Name: 

Virtual Travel Experience 

Project Description: what is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create.

The project is a web page that takes the user through various travel journeys depending on the user’s choices and preferences. The overall concept of the project is to give the user suggestions for destinations of the tour using questions, visuals, and sounds. The overall theme of the project is journey and exploration. Using this project we are striving to create an extraordinary virtual travel event for people tired and stressed due to the pandemic.

Process: How did you go about implementing the concept.

We started with brainstorming for ideas that are journey-based but also interactive. Our initial concept was a call to a travel agency. However, we finally decided that the storyline would be that our website works as a travel agency that asks different questions regarding the traveler’s preference. As a result and based on each of these decisions, the user will be layering up locations until the final destination comes up. There is when the travel recommendation final screen comes to place. Since our storyline is virtual, it was linked to the pandemic and the difficulty of traveling in person. So, the website’s virtual travel event targets users how are tired due to the pandemic and deserve a getaway. 
Interaction between the user and the content of the website was what we wanted. As a result, we made our website to be user-based and gave the user the freedom of choice between different options. Images and audio along with some texts and buttons were used to keep the user engaged.


Reflection/Evaluation: This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.

We initially wanted that based on each of the decisions the user made while clicking the buttons, the user was supposed to be layering up the sounds to make their soundscape. In the end, we wanted to let the user listen to the soundscape they built up themselves. However, due to the limited time we had, we made it that the user listens to the final soundscape without the layering. Our goal was to have the travel agency and the user have a conversation happen in a way. We got it working by recording two different sounds one that resembled the travel agency and the other for the user.
